Python is a scripting language, need an interpreter but not compiler, so it exist in text format but not an executable file.



###Syntax Characteristic

(We will discuss scope later) Beginners of python are easily mess these syntax characteristics.



###Get started 

When start learning a new programming language, the first program is always hello world 
```python
print(“hello world”) 
```
Simple.



###Variables 

A variable is like a box. It stores thing in it, with a tag outside to reach it. Like `x = 1` it is a box with a tag `x` and storing `1` in it. 
Apart from numbers, variable can also store string.
For example `mystring="hello"`




###Calculation 

Python follows mathematical calculation. You can have calculations like `x = 1+2+34(1+3).`
